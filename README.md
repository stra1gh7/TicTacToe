# Tic Tac Toe

The game is quite simple:

### Setup:

It begins by displaying an empty grid with 9 possible spots.

### Player Input

Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the number of the spot where they want to place their symbol (X or O).

### Validation
The game verifies the input to ensure it's a valid move. If the chosen space is already occupied or the input is invalid, the player is prompted to enter a new move.

### Winning Conditions
The game checks after each move if there is a winning pattern (a winning pattern occurs when one player successfully places their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal)

If a winning pattern is found, the game announces the winner.
If the board is filled without a winning pattern, the game declares a draw.
