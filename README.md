#Tic Tac Toe
This classic game of Xs and Os can be played with your friends.

The game is quite simple:

It begins by displaying an empty grid with 9 possible spots.

Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the number of the spot where they want to place their symbol (X or O).
The script verifies the input to ensure it's a valid move. If the chosen space is already occupied or the input is invalid, the player is prompted to enter a new move.
The game checks after each move if there is a winning pattern (a winning pattern occurs when one player successfully places their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal)

If a winning pattern is found, the game announces the winner.
If the board is filled without a winning pattern, the game declares a draw.
